Lab 1 Introduction to C++ Programming
Description: This lab will serve as a demonstration of your
ability to download a project from GitHub, compile and run the
project, upload a project to GitHub, and submit a project
to Google Classroom. This lab assumes you have downloaded and
installed an IDE (integrated development environment) and have
also installed GitHub desktop. If you have not met the assumptions
for this lab, the steps you need to complete the lab may vary from
what is here. The goals are for you to download a project, compile
and run that project, and to upload your own project. If you meet
the goals, you will get the points for this lab. Follow the directions
in this lab and complete the tasks. If you have questions, please ask.
